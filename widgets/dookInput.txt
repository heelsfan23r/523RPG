1:'You are sent on a quest to the nearby land of Dookia, which has been at war with your people of Carolinia for centuries.  Your spies report that the King of Dookia has uncovered a legendary artifact, a powerful ring that gives its possessor the power to cast devestating magic.  The brutal and tyrannous King K plans to march into battle with the ring in one week\'s time to subjugate Carolinia under Dookian rule forever. Knowing that such an artifact could spell doom for Carolinia, you sneak into Dookia territory and approach the castle of the King.  You hope to sneak into the castle, recover the ring, and save your people.'

If you take the clothes of a Dookian merchant, you can talk your way through situations by pretending to be a harmless trader.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian mercenary, you can pretend to be looking for work while being constantly ready for combat.  If you take the dark garb of an assassin, you would arouse more suspicion but easily blend into dark areas. <br>Which clothes did you pick?'

An ancient forest is to the right of the castle.  There is a path that leads to the castle drawbridge and the main gate, which is closed.  Across the drawbridge, there are two guards in full Dookian armor standing by the gate.  On the top of the castle, there are several more guards facing the front of the castle and holding crossbows.  You come up with several ideas to enter the castle, but all of them are risky. <br>  You could try to talk your way past the guards and enter the front gate. <br> You could avoid the guards and try to swim across the moat.  <br> You could hide in the forest and try to shoot the gate guards with a crossbow.  <br> You could go to the back side of the castle and try to grapple up to the roof with a grappling hook.'

95:'LOSEGOLD:5^*The guard takes your delivery and 5 gold pieces and calls for the gate to be opened. The gate opens and the guard walks in.  You start to follow him, but the other guard holds out a hand to stop you.  "You are no longer needed here, mercenary," says the guard, "The delivery will be made."'
95:'Insist that you come with the guard to make sure^*96^*Run past the guard through the open gate^*76^*Leave and try to find another way into the castle^*31'
96:'You are allowed to follow the guard into the castle courtyard.  Knowing that the guard will soon find out that there is no such person as Norman Orwell, you wait until he is distacted and slip in to the crowd of people.  You move around the crowd until the guard is out of sight.'

100:'As you work your way around to the back of the castle looking for a good place to attach your grappling hook, you see two towers with windows that you could grapple to, one to the North and one to the East.  The northern tower is a bit higher than the east but the ledges appear to be the same from the ground.'
100:'Grapple up the Northern Tower^*101^*Grapple up the Eastern Tower^*102'
101:'You swing the hook around and around and launch it up to the ledge of the window on the Northern Tower.  You miss the ledge by a few feet.  After a few more failed tries you realize that your grappling hook is not quite long enough to reach this ledge.'
101:'Keep trying to get up the North Tower by climbing up a nearby tree^*103^*Give up and try the Eastern Tower^*102'
102:'You walk over to the eastern tower and you swing the hook around and around and launch it up to the ledge of the window, it catches and the hold seems firm'
102:'Pull yourself up the grapple^*104^*Reconsider this whole climbing thing and go back around to the front of the castle^*4'
103:'LOSEHEALTH:5^*You climb up to the top of the tree, far enough to where you think the grapple will now reach the North tower.  As you swing the grapple you lose your balance and fall to the ground, causing a loss of 5 health.  You decide not to try that again.'

Though your hands are bound behind your back, you manage to reach the dagger and use it to cut through your restraints.  Using the dagger with bound hands is difficult and you cut yourself several times before you manage to free yourself, causing a loss of 5 health.  This dagger and the clothes on your back are the only items you have left - the guards took everything else.  You are surrounded by three stone cell walls and a study looking barred cell door.'
551:'Search for a way out of your cell^*553^*Save your strength and wait for a guard to approach^*554'
552:'You struggle to free your bound hands from their restraints, but to no avail.  You are surrounded by three stone cell walls and a study looking barred cell door, and you can think of no way out of the cell.  The guards have taken everything but the clothes on your back.  You have no option but to sit in the cell and wait to see what happens to you.'

553:'You run your hands along the stone walls and the floor of the cell, but find nothing unusual.  You test the strength of the cell door, but it is quite sturdy and will not open by force.  The door is locked by a large iron lock with a keyhole.  The only way of escape that you can think of is to reach through the bars of the cell door and try to pick the lock with your dagger, but you would risk breaking the dagger.'

555:'LOSEHEALTH:3^*As you wait in the cell for hours, the ropes tying your hands cut into you, causing you to lose 3 health.  Soon you can no longer feel your arms, and the time passes in a haze of misery.  After a while, you hear footsteps approaching your cell.  In your condition, you don\'t have the strength to try to fight, but you consider feigning illness to get the guards to open the door.'
555:'Pretend to be sick^*558^*Sit in the corner and wait to see what happens^*559'

557:'INVREMOVE:Hidden dagger^*You keep forcing the dagger in the lock, hoping that the clicking sound you heard was the sound of the lock mechanism.  Unfortunately, this gets the dagger jammed in the lock, and when try to pull the dagger out it snaps at the hilt.  You reach around and try to pull the broken blade out of the lock, knowing that the guards would be suspicious otherwise, but the blade is hopelessly stuck. Cursing, you discard the useless dagger handle."'
557:'You have no choice now but to wait for a guard to arrive^*554'
558:'LOSEHEALTH:2^*You have very little pretending to do, as standing up after hours of cramped waiting causes a wave of nausea to overtake you.  You vomit onto the floor (causing a loss of 2 health), and then lie down next to it as the guard approaches.  You hear the cell door being unlocked, and then two hands on your shoulder roughly jerk you upwards.'

You feel yourself being carried over a shoulder for some distance, before your hands are untied and you are set down on a flat surface.
