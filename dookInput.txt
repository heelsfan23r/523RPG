1:The brutal and tyrannous King K of the nearby land of Dookia has uncovered a legendary ring that gives its possessor the power to cast devastating magic.  King K plans to march into battle with the ring in one week's time to subjugate the land of Carolinia under Dookian rule forever.  You are Rameses, an elite Carolinian warrior.  The King of Carolinia has sent you on a quest to King K's castle, the dread castle Dookenstein, in hopes of recovering the ring and saving your country.

2:INVSELECT:1^*In order to pass through Dookia without arousing suspicion, you selected a disguise to enter the country with.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian merchant, you can talk your way through situations by pretending to be a harmless trader.  If you take the clothes of a Dookian mercenary, you can pretend to be looking for work while being constantly ready for combat.  If you take the stealthy dark garb of an assassin, you would arouse more suspicion but easily blend into dark areas. <br>Which clothes did you pick?

4:You manage to arrive at Castle Dookenstein without incident.  The castle is a towering fortress of stone that looms over the countryside, surrounded by a deep moat.  An ancient forest is to the right of the castle.  There is a path that leads to the castle drawbridge and the main gate, which is closed.  Across the drawbridge, there are two guards in full Dookian armor standing by the gate.  On the top of the castle, there are several more guards facing the front of the castle and holding crossbows.  You come up with several ideas to enter the castle, but all of them are risky. <br>  You could try to talk your way past the guards and enter the front gate. <br> You could avoid the guards and try to swim across the moat.  <br> You could hide in the forest and try to shoot the gate guards with a crossbow.  <br> You could go to the back side of the castle and try to grapple up to the roof with a grappling hook.

Despite the heavy vegetation, the soldiers have a clear shot at you.

95:LOSEGOLD:5^*The guard takes your delivery and 5 gold pieces and calls for the gate to be opened. The gate opens and the guard walks in.  You start to follow him, but the other guard holds out a hand to stop you.  "You are no longer needed here, mercenary," says the guard, "The delivery will be made."
95:Insist that you come with the guard to make sure^*96^*Run past the guard through the open gate^*76^*Leave and try to find another way into the castle^*31
96:You are allowed to follow the guard into the castle courtyard.  Knowing that the guard will soon find out that there is no such person as Norman Orwell, you wait until he is distacted and slip in to the crowd of people.  You move around the crowd until the guard is out of sight.

99:"The King has no nephews!" says one of the guards, "You are clearly lying to us, and we will find out why are really trying to enter the castle."  Before you can react, the guards have seized you.
99:Continue^*42
100:As you work your way around to the back of the castle looking for a good place to attach your grappling hook, you see two towers with windows that you could grapple to, one to the North and one to the East.  The northern tower is a bit higher than the east but the ledges appear to be the same from the ground.
100:Grapple up the Northern Tower^*101^*Grapple up the Eastern Tower^*102
101:You swing the hook around and around and launch it up to the ledge of the window on the Northern Tower.  You miss the ledge by a few feet.  After a few more failed tries you realize that your grappling hook is not quite long enough to reach this ledge.
101:Keep trying to get up the North Tower by climbing up a nearby tree^*103^*Give up and try the Eastern Tower^*102
102:You walk over to the eastern tower and you swing the hook around and around and launch it up to the ledge of the window, it catches and the hold seems firm
102:Pull yourself up the grapple^*104^*Reconsider this whole climbing thing and go back around to the front of the castle^*4
103:LOSEHEALTH:5^*You climb up to the top of the tree, far enough to where you think the grapple will now reach the North tower.  As you swing the grapple you lose your balance and fall to the ground, causing a loss of 5 health.  You decide not to try that again.
103:Try the Eastern tower^*102^*Go back to the castle entrance^*4
200:Making sure that none of the patrolling castle guards can see you, you make your way over to the side of the castle and search for entrances near the moat.  You see a 3 foot by 3 foot square tunnel in the side of the castle that is covered by a rusty metal grate with a large lock on it.  You see a small, slime covered waste disposal hole that you could try to squeeze through, but you do not relish the thought.  You see a patch of uneven bricks that you could attempt to scale, but the nearest window that you could enter is 40 feet from the ground.
200:Swim towards the tunnel with the grating^*201^*Swim towards the small hole^*202^*Swim towards the uneven bricks and try to scale the wall^*203
201:LOSEHEALTH:5^*As you prepare to jump into the moat, your nose is greeted by a truly foul stench.  The moat water is the filthiest water you've ever seen, and you almost vomit at the thought of trying to swim through it.  Eventually, you muster the courage to hold your breath and dive into the moat.  As you swim, you accidently get some of the water in your mouth, which makes you instantly gag.  You struggle across the moat and are barely able to grab on to the grate, where you spend a few minutes choking and gagging.  Swallowing the disgusting moat water has caused you to lose 5 health.

You struggle across the moat and are barely able to grab on to one of the bricks on the other side.  You slowly and painfully pull yourself up the bricks, which cut into your hands as you try to climb them.  You manage to make it up a good distance before your aching hands lose their grip, causing you to plummet into the moat below.  You hit the moat with such force that it knocks you out, and you end up floating facedown in it. <br>Your life ends here.

As you try to struggle through headfirst, fetid water drips off of your clothing and you are coated with a layer of slime.  On the other side, you see what looks like a servant's washroom.  After several long minutes of struggling, you manage to get your bruised body through.  The painful struggle has cost you another 5 health. 
205:Wash yourself and your clothes off in the washroom^*208^*Leave the room before someone arrives^*209
206:You climb up the grate and pull your lockpicking kit out of your pack.  The lock is rusted and very difficult to pick, but eventually you manage to get it open.  You let the lock fall into the moat and the grate swings open.  You climb in to what appears to be an exit tunnel from the castle.  There is not much light coming in from outside, and the tunnel descends into pitch darkness very quickly.

207:You climb up the grate and try to pull it open, but the rusted lock keeps it firmly attached.  You try to force the lock, but to no avail.  The lock and the grate are both made of solid metal and there is no way past them.  You have no choice but to abandon the tunnel.

213:As you crawl into the tunnel, you use your tinderbox to light your torch.  Fortunately, your pack managed to keep it dry during your swim.  You crawl past walls that have cracked with age and brush away several cobwebs.  Suddenly, you hear the pattering of many tiny feet.  You see a swarm of rats approaching you.

You continue to crawl forwards, forcing the rats back with your torch each time.  This works for a while, until several of the hungry rats decide to try to leap past the torch to get to you.  You react quickly, swatting them down with the torch and setting them ablaze.  The rats run around in panic, setting others in the swarm on fire.  You quickly back away from the blazing mass of rats, but the smoke filling up the tunnel is too much for your lungs and you pass out from the lack of oxygen.

After you think you have passed most of the rats, you slam your arm against the wall, stunning the rats that were attached to you.

338:You try to get a higher price for your horse and cart but the stablemaster is a shrewd negotiator.  You eventually are forced to settle for his original offer.
338:Continue^*337
339:GAINGOLD:7^*The stable boy runs in to fetch the owner of the stables, who offers you 7 gold coins for your horse.  Since you don't need the horse, you accept the offer and the stablemaster pays you.  Now that you longer have your horse and cart, you can safely return to the merchant stalls.

340:RESTART:^*As you sprint away from the guard, he gives a shout of warning and points in your direction.  Several guards converge from the courtyard, and they cut you down with their swords.  Your life ends here.

341:The barracks is a very wide building that is connected to part of the castle wall.  The barracks is very busy right now and guards are coming in and out of the entrance.  Behind the barracks, many soldiers are sparring with each other and with training dummies in a fenced off field.  Inside several windows of the barracks, you see an array of beds.  Inside the main entrance of the barracks, you see a large chamber where a huge man with scars crossing his face is talking to a group of soldiers and guards.  As you approach, one of the guards accosts you and asks you what you are doing.
341:Say you have a delivery for the soldiers^*344^*Ask him if he wants to buy any of your goods^*345^*Say that you were just passing by^*346

343:Tell him that you need the help of the guards^*348^*Tell him that you are looking for a job as a guard^*347^*Leave and go back to the courtyard^*300
344:The guard calls for Colonel Graywald.  The man with scars crossing his face walks over to you.  The guard tells him that you have brought a delivery and the colonel looks at the contents of your cart.  "There was no delivery requested," says the colonel, "And we already have plenty of food supplies.  Get this man out of my sight and find out why he is lying to me."  Several of the guards immediately seize you.
344:Continue^*42
345:"You are not allowed to sell your goods outside of the trading district," says the guard.  "Get out of here and stop wasting my time before I have you arrested!"  You lead your horse and cart back into the courtyard.

550:INVSPLIT:Hidden dagger^*551^*552
550:null^*1
551:LOSEHEALTH:5^*The guards did not manage to find the hidden dagger that you concealed on your person.  Though your hands are bound behind your back, you manage to reach the dagger and use it to cut through your restraints.  Using the dagger with bound hands is difficult and you cut yourself several times before you manage to free yourself, causing a loss of 5 health.  This dagger and the clothes on your back are the only items you have left - the guards took everything else.  You are surrounded by three stone cell walls and a study looking barred cell door.
551:Search for a way out of your cell^*553^*Save your strength and wait for a guard to approach^*554
552:You struggle to free your bound hands from their restraints, but to no avail.  You are surrounded by three stone cell walls and a study looking barred cell door, and you can think of no way out of the cell.  The guards have taken everything but the clothes on your back.  You have no option but to sit in the cell and wait to see what happens to you.
552:Continue^*555
553:You run your hands along the stone walls and the floor of the cell, but find no structural weaknesses.  You test the strength of the cell door, but it is quite sturdy and will not open by force.  The door is locked by a large iron lock with a keyhole.  The only way of escape that you can think of is to reach through the bars of the cell door and try to pick the lock with your dagger, but you would risk breaking the dagger.
553:Pick the lock with the dagger^*556^*Save your strength and wait for a guard^*554
554:INVCHECK:Hidden dagger^*You hide your dagger in your clothes and wait for a guard to approach.  After hours of waiting, you finally hear footsteps approaching your cell.^*560
554:Content not added^*1
555:LOSEHEALTH:3^*As you wait in the cell for hours, the ropes tying your hands cut into you, causing you to lose 3 health.  Soon you can no longer feel your arms, and the time passes in a haze of misery.  After a while, you hear footsteps approaching your cell.  In your condition, you don't have the strength to try to fight, but you consider feigning illness to get the guards to open the door.
555:Pretend to be sick^*558^*Sit in the corner and wait to see what happens^*559
556:Your arm barely fits through the bars on the door, so your lockpicking attempt is very clumsy.  You move the dagger around in the keyhole until you hear a click as the dagger catches against something.
556:Keep moving the dagger around in the lock^*557^*Pull the dagger out of the lock and wait for a guard instead^*554
557:INVREMOVE:Hidden dagger^*You keep forcing the dagger in the lock, hoping that the clicking sound you heard was the sound of the lock mechanism.  Unfortunately, this gets the dagger jammed in the lock, and when you try to pull the dagger out it snaps at the hilt.  You reach around and try to pull the broken blade out of the lock, knowing that the guards would be suspicious otherwise, but the blade is hopelessly stuck. Cursing, you discard the useless dagger handle.  You have no choice now but to wait for a guard to arrive.
557:Continue^*554
558:LOSEHEALTH:2^*You have very little pretending to do, as standing up after hours of cramped waiting causes a wave of nausea to overtake you.  You vomit onto the floor (causing a loss of 2 health), and then lie down next to it as the guard approaches.  You hear the cell door being unlocked, and then two hands on your shoulder roughly jerk you upwards.
558:Close your eyes and pretend to be unconscious^*561^*Lash out with your feet^*562

561:You are roughly shaken, but you let your body go limp and show no reaction.  You feel yourself being carried over a shoulder for some distance, before your hands are untied and you are set down on a flat surface.  A strange, bitter liquid is forced into your mouth, and you feel a hand pinch your nose, which would force you to swallow it.
561:Open your eyes and spit it out^*563^*Swallow the bitter liquid^*564
562:LOSEHEALTH:6^*You swiftly lash out with your right foot, only to badly bruise it on a piece of armor.  The guard that you kicked reacts by punching you hard in the chest and letting you crumple to the floor.  You lose 6 health.
562:Content not added^*1
563:As you spit out the liquid, you see it splash on to the face of what looks like a doctor.  Crying out, he lets go of your nose and clutches his eyes with his hands.  You are on an operating table in an infirmary, and you see a guard in Dookian uniform standing to your left.  He quickly draws a mace and prepares to strike you with it.

564:GAINHEALTH:5^*You continue to pretend to be unconsious, but the hand on your nose forces you to swallow the bitter liquid.  You feel a tingling throughout your body, and you feel rejuvenated (You gain 5 health).  You are lifted up and your arms are retied behind your back, and then water is splashed on your face.  Coughing and sputtering, you look around the room.
564:Continue^*565
565:You are in the infirmary of the castle, standing next to an operating table.  Most of the operating tables around you are empty.  Next to you are an armed Dookian guard and a person who looks like a doctor holding an empty bucket.

However, the King reacts quickly and flicks his ring finger towards you, sending an arc of lightning from his ring that stops you in your tracks. Your body does not survive the resulting shock.

614:RESTART:^*Now that the King is alone, it is the perfect time to attack him.

615:RESTART:^*Now that the King is alone, it is the perfect time to attack him.

However, the King sees you lunge and sends a powerful blast of magic from his ring, instantly ending your life.

616:The guards start to protest but the King brushes aside their concern.  "This man can do me no harm," he announces, "Leave my presence so he can tell me his information."  The soldiers disperse, grumbling to themselves.  "Now what is it you wanted to tell me?" asks King K.

617:The urgency of your tone convinces the guards and they reluctantly decide to allow you an audience with the King.  "You had better not be wasting his time," says one of the guards, "Or he will execute you on the spot."  The castle gate is opened and a regiment of soldiers lead you to the throne room.  You enter the throne room, and can see King K sitting on a golden throne that is draped with dark blue tapestries.  The King has an ornate golden ring upon his finger and carries a scepter in his hand. One of the soldiers announces that you have a message for the King.  "What message is that?" demands King K.
